=========================

A simple to use, alternative, lightweight and responsive jQuery Accordion plugin.

**Demo:** http://www.cloud-eight.com/github/responsive-accordion/


Usage
=====

  <ul>
  	<li>Link both the responsive-accordion.css and responsive-accordion.js files into your document</li>
    <li>Create an unordered list and give it a class name 'accordion'</li>
    <li>In each list item place 2 div's</li>
    <li>The first div apply the class name 'accordion-head'</li>
    <li>The second div apply the class name 'accordion-panel'</li>
    <li>In the 'accordion-head' div place the title of that section</li>
    <li>In the 'accordion-panel' div place the contents of the above section</li>

You can also use 2 elements in the 'accordion-head' div to display icons/images for when the panel is expanded or collapsed. Giving each element a name of either 'plus' or 'minus', in the demo we have used FontAwesome icons.
